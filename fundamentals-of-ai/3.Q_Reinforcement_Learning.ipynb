    "## What is **Reinforcement Learning**?\n",
    "An agent (like a robot or program) learns to make decisions through **trial and error**, receiving **rewards** or **penalties**.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Example: Simple Maze\n",
    "Weâ€™ll create a 4x4 maze where the agent starts at (0,0) and must reach the goal (3,3).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Code Steps:\n",
    "1. Define the maze and rewards.\n",
    "2. Implement the Q-Learning algorithm.\n",
    "3. Train the agent and visualize the learned policy.\n"
